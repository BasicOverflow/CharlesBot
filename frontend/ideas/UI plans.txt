For web UI:
have a landing page that has an input box to enter command
then when the user submits something, have a new page open up that hosts the ws connection with the queue,
have an area to display the queues responses and an area to input further inqueries (like a chat)

-On landing page:
	have an about and/or how to use page with examples
		How to use has a dropdown with two options: how to input commands & examples
	list all current features it has (maybe use javascript to update this list automatically from intents.json)
	-Maybe have 'Download Client' page (*Only supports pc*)
